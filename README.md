# Exploratory Data Analysis Project
THe purpose of this project was to explore data using graphs from the base and ggplot2 plotting systems to answer insightful questions.


The raw data was obtained from the [National Emissions Inventory (NEI)](https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html).

- Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?

Yes. Produced plot:

- Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in Baltimore from 1999 to 2008?

Overall, yes. Although it increased at some point. Produced plot:

- Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City?

The Nonpoint, nonroad, and onroad sources have seen decreases. Produced plot:

- Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

They have decreased. Produced plot:

- Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

Los Angeles had the larger increase. Produced plot:
